* ideas
** shops
   We need to spend the gold somewhere.
   Weapons: buy better weapons - base damage increase. They need higher skill levels, have unique abilities (life drain, pierce, etc).
   Armour: better base armour?
   Skills: skill books for advanced skills
   Spells/Abilities: books for spells and stuff
   Items: potions, quest items
*** weapon/armour upgrades should be bought
*** different type: weapon, armour, skills, spells/abilities, items
** inventory
*** potions
	Health, mana, both. Temporary upgrade potions like damage, armour.
** skills
*** paging for selection
*** DONE dependencies
	CLOSED: [2017-12-14 Thu 14:57]
*** DONE block
	CLOSED: [2017-12-12 Tue 12:16]
** tweaks
*** DONE initial levels <10 are too quick
	CLOSED: [2017-12-19 Tue 16:41]
	cap monster levels and type early on, slow down xp gain, leave bigger monsters for later levels
*** DONE after a while the hero becomes unbeatable
	CLOSED: [2017-12-13 Wed 16:07]
*** enemies should attack on their own (+flee)
*** enemy armour should scale with levels
** spells and abilities
*** mana
*** DONE skill books
	CLOSED: [2017-12-14 Thu 14:57]
*** cast spell/use ability or attack
*** DONE basic/intermediate/normal/improved/expert/master skills
	CLOSED: [2017-12-19 Tue 16:35]
** maps
*** DONE tree structure instead of linear
	CLOSED: [2017-12-12 Tue 15:46]
*** DONE dungeons/block of levels, spawning distinct type of enemies
	CLOSED: [2017-12-12 Tue 15:46]
*** restrict level/dungeon access by hero level and/or keys
*** boss creatures
*** DONE make levels less open - force corridors
	CLOSED: [2017-12-13 Wed 16:07]
** heroes
*** class specialisation
** bugs
*** DONE interact doubles prompt
	CLOSED: [2017-12-12 Tue 12:18]
*** DONE unknown key acts as pass in combat mode
	CLOSED: [2017-12-12 Tue 12:18]
*** TODO move weapon (and type) level to hero
	This is to avoid issues like a level45 bow being exchanged for a level45 wand when the hero never used magic before.
** game
*** DONE Add prompt for quit
	CLOSED: [2017-12-14 Thu 14:58]
** monsters
*** scaling is really bad
** redo combat [4/7]
*** DONE distance
	CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 17:56]
	Combat starts with two players on the opposite side with a certain distance from each other (skills can manipulate this).
	Movement attribute decides the max distance that can be travelled in one move (perhaps do something like flee or whatnot).
	This would increase the distinction between melee and ranged attackers.
*** TODO speed
	Instead of having a static turn-based behaviour it would be better to have one based on time slots. Someone with speed 10 would have two turns, while someone with 5 would have only one.
	This would give way to high damage, slow and quick, but weaker weapons.
*** DONE ranged/melee
	CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 17:56]
	Ranged attacks would be penalised by distance, i.e. too far = lower chance to hit; point-blank range chance to hit penalised without skill.
*** TODO add abilities
	Stuff like 'pommel strike' or 'power shot' would really increase the game's enjoyment factor.
*** DONE adjust magic attack
	CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 17:56]
	It will be considered ranged, with no range penalty, but serious chance of failure for point-blank range.
*** DONE ranged precision
	CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 17:56]
	This should be turned into chance to hit. Also, adding 'optimal distance' for ranged weapon might be a good idea.
*** TODO new skills
	Point-blank shot is required for ranged weapons (not core skill). Combat casting for point-blank magic attacks.
