** shops [0/2]
   We need to spend the gold somewhere.
   Weapons: buy better weapons - base damage increase. They need higher skill levels, have unique abilities (life drain, pierce, etc).
   Armour: better base armour?
   Skills: skill books for advanced skills
   Spells/Abilities: books for spells and stuff
   Items: potions, quest items
*** TODO weapon/armour upgrades should be bought
*** TODO different type: weapon, armour, skills, spells/abilities, items
** inventory [1/2]

	i.e. a robe on a wolf doesn't quite feel right
*** TODO weapon prices should be adjusted by their attributes
	Like critical or spell amp.
